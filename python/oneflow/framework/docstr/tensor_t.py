    oneflow.t(input) â†’ Tensor.

        Expects `input` to be <= 2-D tensor and transposes dimensions 0 and 1. 

        0-D and 1-D tensors are returned as is. When input is a 2-D tensor this is equivalent to `transpose(input, 0, 1)`.

    Args:
        input (oneflow.Tensor): An input tensor.   
 
    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import oneflow as flow
        >>> import numpy as np

        >>> x = flow.randn()
        >>> x
        tensor(-0.2048, dtype=oneflow.float32)
        >>> flow.t(x)
        tensor(-0.2048, dtype=oneflow.float32)
        >>> x = flow.randn(3)
        >>> x
        tensor([ 0.5034, -0.4999,  0.2721], dtype=oneflow.float32)
        >>> flow.t(x)
        tensor([ 0.5034, -0.4999,  0.2721], dtype=oneflow.float32)
        >>> x = flow.randn(2,3)
